GitHub Notifier is a Chrome extension for notifying you of pull requests, etc.

On the first iteration, it will only support GitHub:Enterprise, since there are already extensions available that work with regular GitHub.

TODO:

* Add watch list to options page
* Graceful handling of non-configured state
* Display summary pull requests in pop-up
* Support public GitHub URLs
